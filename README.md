## Projects
#### Hotel Review Sentiment Classification (MAY 2023 - JUNE 2023)
- Analyzed TripAdvisor hotel reviews to predict sentiment using deep learning models.  
- Preprocessed data via normalization, morpheme analysis, stopword removal, and tokenization.  
- Achieved **89.77% accuracy** with **CNN** and **91.08% accuracy** with **LSTM**. 
  
#### Cicadas Sound Detection (AUGUST 2023 - NOVEMBER 2023)
- Trained **ResNet50** to classify cicada calls from audio data.  
- Preprocessed data (WAV conversion, STFT spectrograms, resizing, augmentation).  
- Achieved **94.17% accuracy** with an **F1 score of 0.89**, despite some label imbalance.

#### US Election Analysis (JUNE 2024 - NOVEMBER 2024)
- Analyzed U.S. federal election results from 1988 to 2020 to identify swing states.
- Preprocessed data, applied scaling, and used PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and trend visualization.
- Identified **[Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada, Michigan, Arizona]** as swing states based on both popular vote and electoral vote trends.
