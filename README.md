### Projects
#### Hotel Review Sentiment Classification (MAY 2023 - JUNE 2023)
- This project analyzes hotel reviews from TripAdvisor to predict sentiment using deep learning models.
- Data preprocessing includes normalization, morpheme analysis, stopword removal, and tokenization.
- The CNN model achieved 89.77% accuracy, while the LSTM model performed slightly better at 91.08%.
  
#### Cicadas Sound Detection (AUGUST 2023 - NOVEMBER 2023)
- This project trains ResNet50 to classify cicada calls from audio data.
- After preprocessing (WAV conversion, STFT spectrograms, resizing, and augmentation), the model achieved 94.17% accuracy with an F1 score of 0.89.
- The confusion matrix showed some label imbalance, but the model performed well overall.
- The approach can also be applied to classify other insect and animal sounds.
